          <div>
            <b>How it works</b>
              <p>
                <em>Computers communicate over the web by sending a HTTP Request to a server</em>. the server sends back the correct web page document to the users browser. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48329854/m-48480496" target="_blank">This video</a> does a good job showing you how the web works.
              </p>

          <div>
            <b>HTML</b>
              <p>
                HTML Documents make up the majority of the Web. HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>. This language is how the web is coded.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <b>Elements - Inline vs Block</b>
              <p>
                Elements are either <b>inline or block</b>. The block elements have an invisible block around them. You can adjust the height and width of the invisible block.

          <div>
            <b>Developer Tools</b>
              <p>
                Google Chrome has great developer tools. Click the menu in the top right corner, select more tools and then select developer tools. You can quickly access the Developer Tools by right click and clicking, <em>Inspect Element</em>.
              </p>
            <b>The DOM</b>
              <p>
                HTML uses a tre like structure called the <b>DOM</b>. You can draw lines between each element in the <b>DOM</b>.
              </p>
            <b>HTML is just Boxes!</b>
              <p>
                HTML content is just boxes. When you see the PDF layout, you can  asses how many elements may be needed by using a pencil to outline each box.
              </p>
            <b>Text Editors</b>
              <p>
                Writing code us much easier if you are using a text editor like <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com" targer="_blank">Sublime Text 2</a>. The editor helps you visually see where each element is indented (nested).
